Carcass is a command line tool and OCaml library to define and generate
file and directory structures. 

The primary aim of Carcass is to help programmers to quickly setup new
software projects and deal with source and licensing boilerplate
during program development. Carcass is agnostic to content.

Carcass is distributed under the ISC license.
